Growlr
======

Give your rails apps growl based notifications. Basically a rails plugin wrapper for Stan's excellent jGrowl library. This is a nice alternative to static flash messages, plus it integrates with flash[:notice] and flash[:error] automatically.

Requirements
============

- Jquery 1.2.6

Installation
============

1. rake growlr:install
2. include the following snippet in your layout or view file
   <%= include_growlr %>

Usage
======

Growlr will automatically detect flash messages and display them accordingly. You can explicitly call Growlr by doing:

   <%= growl "hello peoples" %>

You can also pass the same options as the jgrowl plugin.
