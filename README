Growlr
======

Give your rails apps growl based notifications. Basically a rails plugin wrapper for Stan's excellent jGrowl library. This is a nice alternative to static flash messages, plus it integrates with flash[:notice] and flash[:error] automatically.

Requirements
============

- Jquery 1.2.6
- Cookies should be enabled --it should be by default 

Installation
============

1. rake growlr:install:all
2. include the following snippet in your layout or view file, preferably in the
   head section.

     <%= include_growlr %>

Usage 
======

Growlr will automatically detect flash messages and display them accordingly. You can explicitly call Growlr by writing the following in your action or controller:

   growl "hello peoples"

You can also pass the same options as the jgrowl plugin.

Todo's
======

x complete the growl method
x add all the jquery and jgrowl asset files
2. work on the yml processing for the config files - should have support for multiple configs in one yaml file
3. create rake installers
4. write the functional specs
